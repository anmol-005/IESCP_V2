# Debugging the Influencer Login Navbar Issue [#1]

## Problem Description
When logging in as an influencer, the navbar was not updating correctly and continued to show login and register links instead of the influencer-specific navigation links.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **API Endpoint Issue**: The `/api/get_user_data` endpoint had the `@login_required` decorator which redirected unauthenticated users instead of returning data with authentication status.
2. **Data Refresh Timing**: The navbar component wasn't properly refreshing user data after route changes.
3. **Session Handling**: There may have been issues with how the session cookie was being processed.

## Fixes Implemented
1. Modified the `/api/get_user_data` endpoint to:
   - Remove the `@login_required` decorator
   - Handle unauthenticated users gracefully by returning proper status
   
2. Enhanced the navbar component to:
   - Add a route watcher to refresh data on route changes
   - Include proper error handling
   - Add debugging logs

3. Added test utilities:
   - Created `/api/auth_debug` endpoint to verify authentication status
   - Developed a test page at `/test_navbar` for isolated testing

## Testing Process
1. Log in as an influencer using credentials
2. Verify authentication state using the debug endpoint
3. Check that the navbar properly shows the influencer-specific links

## Behavior after Fix
- The navbar now correctly updates after login
- User sessions are properly maintained
- Role-specific links are displayed as expected

## Additional Notes
- Browser cache may need to be cleared if issues persist
- The application uses Vue.js for frontend with Flask backend
- Authentication is handled via Flask-Security

## Debug Console Output Examples

When testing the influencer login flow, you'll see the following console logs that help diagnose the authentication state:

### During Login Attempt
```
Attempting login with: influencer@example.com
Login successful: {role: "influencer", redirect: "/influencer_dashboard"}
Auth debug data: {
  "authenticated": true,
  "email": "influencer@example.com",
  "roles": ["influencer"],
  "session_info": {
    "cookie_configured": true
  },
  "user_id": 3
}
```

### Navbar Component Logs
```
Navbar: Fetching user data...
Navbar: Auth debug data: {
  "authenticated": true,
  "email": "influencer@example.com",
  "roles": ["influencer"],
  "session_info": {
    "cookie_configured": true
  },
  "user_id": 3
}
Navbar: User data loaded: {
  "isLoggedIn": true,
  "role": "influencer",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "additional_data": {}
}
```

### Common Error States
```
Navbar: Failed to fetch user data: 401
Navbar: Error fetching user data: TypeError: Failed to fetch
Login failed: {error: "Invalid credentials"}
```

### Test Page Output
When using the `/test_navbar` endpoint, you should see output similar to:
```
Auth data: {
  "authenticated": true,
  "email": "influencer@example.com",
  "roles": ["influencer"],
  "session_info": {
    "cookie_configured": true
  },
  "user_id": 3
}
User data: {
  "isLoggedIn": true,
  "role": "influencer",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "additional_data": {}
}
```

These debug logs help identify whether:
1. The user is properly authenticated
2. The session is maintained across requests
3. The correct role is assigned
4. The navbar component is receiving the proper user data
